## Comments
Great work!

### HTML
Search for `prof comment` in individual files for specific comments.

### CSS
Search for `prof comment` in individual files for specific comments.

### Responsive Design
- There is some inconsistency in the width and alignment of different section content. Ideally all sections should have the same width of container, and the same padding on the left and right, applied through the `.container`, to ensure everything lines up perfectly.
  - The navbar and footer have different padding values applied to the sides causing a misalignment.
  - In your blog content, you have applied both gap on the grid, and padding on each item within the grid (via inner `container` class which is unnecessary). This is doubling up the spacing and causing misalignment. I'd recommend just using gap, and not put any padding on the items within the grid other than within the callouts.
